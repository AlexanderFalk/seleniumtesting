You can find the discussion in [this document](https://github.com/AlexanderFalk/seleniumtesting/blob/master/Test%20assignment%20selenium%20-%20Alexander%20Falk.pdf).  
  
And the image with the test [results here](https://github.com/AlexanderFalk/seleniumtesting/blob/master/SeleniumPngTesting.PNG). The whole test "suite" failed, even though each test completed correct. Not sure why that happened. Might be a bug.
